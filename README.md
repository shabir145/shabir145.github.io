## About 🛠️

The Organize Tool helps you manage and sort files in your directories with ease. It automatically categorizes files into folders based on their file extensions, making your directories neat and organized.

## Benefits ✨

- ⏳ **Time-Saving**: Automatically sorts files, reducing manual effort.
- 📁 **Enhanced Organization**: Creates separate directories for different file types.
- 🖥️ **Cross-Platform**: Supports both Linux and Windows environments.
- 👍 **Ease of Use**: Simple setup and intuitive operation.

## How It Works 🔧

The Organize Tool scans a directory, identifies files by their extensions, and moves them into corresponding subdirectories. For example:

- `.txt` files go to a folder named `txt`.
- `.jpg` files go to a folder named `jpg`.
- Unknown file types are placed in a folder named `unknown_file_type`.
