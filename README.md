Organize Tool
Effortlessly organize your files in directories.
About
The Organize Tool helps you manage and sort files in your directories with ease. It automatically categorizes files into folders based on their file extensions, making your directories neat and organized. This is especially useful for developers, content creators, and anyone dealing with a large number of files.
Benefits
•	Time-Saving: Automatically sorts files, reducing manual effort.
•	Enhanced Organization: Creates separate directories for different file types.
•	Cross-Platform: Supports both Linux and Windows environments.
•	Ease of Use: Simple setup and intuitive operation.
How It Works
The Organize Tool scans a directory, identifies files by their extensions, and moves them into corresponding subdirectories. For example, .txt files will be placed in a folder named txt, .jpg files in jpg, and so on. Unknown file types are categorized into a folder named unknown_file_type.
Setup Instructions

For Windows:

Add the tool to your system PATH:

setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\path\to\directory" /M

Run CMD as administrator to apply the changes.

For Linux:

Move the tool to a globally accessible location:

sudo mv /path/to/directory /usr/local/bin/

Ensure the directory is accessible globally.
